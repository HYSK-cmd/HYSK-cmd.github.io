                            For this project, my team and I are developing a TARS robot inspired by movie <span class="interstellar">'Interstellar'</span>.
                            We are divided into three main sub-teams-Mechanical, Electrical, and Software-and I am part of the Software sub-team.
                            During the first quarter, I mainly focused on integrating an AI ChatBot and prototyping a light-weight mini dashboard to visualize system status and telemetry.
                            I used three API keys for STT, text response, and TTS to fully integrate the AI ChatBot pipeline.
                            <br> <br>
                            In the next two quarters, our software team will be focusing on integrating motor control, real-time telemetry, and autonomous behavior,
                            while collaborating closely with the electrical and mechanical teams to ensure seamless system integration.
                            <br> <br>
                            Below is the hierarchical flow diagram of the system and theoretical architecture design of zero-shot vision-language model that will be experimented on TARS.

                            I made a simple command-line tool in C to analyze and filter out log files. It is designed to help more easily inspect and interpret application logs.
                            I created a function that parses a common timestamp-level message format, offers features like filtering log entries by level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR), and sorts entries by time. 
                            It produces a summary count of each log level and I plan to extend its funtionalities by including additional output formats or log structures.
                            By transforming raw text logs into structured and filtered output, it facilitates faster debugging and clearer understanding of runtime behavior.

                            <br> <br>
                            I am currently involved in Professor Mohmmad Al Faraque's Research Lab.
                            During my first quarter, I was tasked with exploring capabilities of the OpenUAV Vision-Language Action(VLA) model and conducting training and performance evaluations.
                            To analyze datasets, I have built several Python scripts on top of this platform, including formatting results for each scene,
                            creating a video out of sequential frames using OpenCV, and visualizing 3D plot trajectories for a comparison between model-predicted and ground truth trajectories.
                            <br> <br>
                            In addition, I am currently developing a zero-shot LLM-based software controller deployed on a physical drone (DJI Tello). This work aims to evaluate 
                            whether the proposed approach can operate reliably in real-world, practical environments beyond simulation, and to better understand the challenges of 
                            transferring VLA models to physical robotic systems.

                                        My first OPS project was to build a simple LED circuit using 9V battery. 
                                        I first constructed the circuit on a breadboard, then moved on to soldering it onto a perfboard.
                                        A simple Ohm's Law calculation was required to determine the appropriate resistor value.

                                        In this project, I built a three-key electronic piano using a 555 Timer IC.
                                        I configured the circuit in astable mode to generate oscillating signals, which were then fed to a passive piezo buzzer, along with a capacitor
                                        to filter out low frequencies to produce clean sound. Different resistor values were used to output different pitches for each corresponding push button.
                                        Once tested successfully on a breadboard, I soldered it onto a custom-designed PCB.

                                        For this project, I programmed an ESP32-C3Fx4 to control a dimmable light using three potentiometers. 
                                        I developed Arduino code that reads potentiometer input and uses PWM signals to dynamically control

                                        Continuing with the ESP32, I implemented an embedded control system in which servo motion is 
                                        adjusted based on distance measurements from an ultrasonic sensor. The servo angle switches between 0° and 90°
